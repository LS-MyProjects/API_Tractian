## Troubleshooting

- **API Not Accessible:** Ensure the server is running by checking the terminal output.
- **Dependency Issues:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install missing dependencies.
- **Swagger Documentation Not Visible:** Confirm that `flasgger` is installed and that youâ€™ve started the Flask app.
